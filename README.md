# 3D Editor
Welcome to the 3D Editor project!

# Overview
This project is a 3D editor application developed using C++ and OpenGL. It allows users to create, modify, and visualize 3D models in real-time. The editor provides a user-friendly interface for manipulating objects, applying materials, and adjusting camera settings.

# Features
- Model Creation: Easily create 3D models using a variety of methods, including primitive shapes such as cubes, spheres, cones, and cylinders, as well as importing existing models.
- Object Manipulation: Effortlessly move, rotate, and scale objects within the scene to achieve the desired layout and composition. Arrange elements precisely to bring your vision to life.
- Texture Mapping: Apply textures to objects to enhance their visual appeal and realism. Utilize a wide range of textures and patterns to add depth and detail to your models.
- Camera Manipulation: Control the camera to view the scene from different perspectives and angles.
- Model Import: Effortlessly import 3D models in various formats, including Wavefront OBJ, for compatibility with other software and collaboration with colleagues. Easily integrate models created in other applications into your projects to enhance your workflow.
